## Configuration Examples
```vim
" Add to .vimrc or my_configs.vim

" Start NERDTree when Vim starts
autocmd VimEnter * NERDTree

" Start NERDTree and put cursor in main window
autocmd VimEnter * NERDTree | wincmd p

" Show hidden files
let NERDTreeShowHidden=1

" Set window size
let g:NERDTreeWinSize=35

" Ignore certain files
let g:NERDTreeIgnore = ['^node_modules$']

" Show line numbers
let g:NERDTreeShowLineNumbers=1

" Enable mouse
let g:NERDTreeMouseMode=3
```

## Tips and Tricks
1. Double-click to open directories/files
2. Use `ctrl+w w` to switch between NERDTree and file windows
3. Use `I` to toggle hidden files quickly
4. Use `m` menu for most file operations
5. Use bookmarks for quick navigation

## Troubleshooting
1. If NERDTree doesn't open:
```vim
:echo g:NERDTree_loaded  " Should return 1
```

2. Check if plugin is installed:
```vim
:scriptnames | grep nerd
```

3. Reload NERDTree:
```vim
:NERDTreeToggle
:NERDTreeToggle
```

## Advanced Features
