## Tips and Tricks
1. Use `.` to repeat last change
2. Use `ci"` to change text inside quotes
3. Use `%` to jump between matching brackets
4. Use `ctrl+a` and `ctrl+x` to increment/decrement numbers
5. Use `gf` to go to file under cursor
6. Use `ctrl+o` and `ctrl+i` to jump through locations
7. Use `q:` to open command history
8. Use `g;` and `g,` to move through edit locations

## Custom Mappings Example
```vim
" In .vimrc
nnoremap <space> za     " Toggle fold with space
nnoremap ; :            " Use ; for commands
inoremap jk <esc>       " Exit insert mode with jk
```

## Common Workflows
1. Change inside quotes: `ci"`
2. Delete inside parentheses: `di(`
3. Change until character: `ct{char}`
4. Delete until character: `dt{char}`
5. Change entire function: `ci{`
6. Format entire file: `gg=G`
7. Sort lines: `:'<,'>sort`
8. Remove duplicates: `:'<,'>sort u`
